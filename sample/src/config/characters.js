    title: 'Mario',
    description:
      "Mario is the perfect character for beginners. He's balanced in virtually every way, which is understandable since he's the mascot of Nintendo. His special moves consists of fireballs, a super jump, and a spin attack that seems to originate from Super Mario World. His Cape move from later games is not present. His standard attacks deliver an appropriate amount of damage, though most people have a hard time with long range attacks, and come out victorious against characters like Donkey Kong. He is very similar to Luigi in terms of the attacks he can perform, though there are differences between the two."

    title: 'Donkey Kong',
    description:
      "In Super Smash Bros. Donkey Kong is modeled after his appearance in Rare's Donkey Kong video games. He sports his red tie with his logo on it and is one of the most powerful characters in the game, with the downside of being one of the slowest as well. His standard special Giant Punch is one of the game's most powerful, though executing it at full potential can be a challenge since it has to be charged at first. Donkey Kong is usually regarded as the best player to use during the team sections of the single player mode due to his power."

    title: 'Link',
    description:
      "Link appears to be based on his adult appearance from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. He specializes in both close up combat and ranged combat thanks to his sword and his boomerang and bombs. Like Mario, Link is good for beginners, though may be a bit more challenging to master. He's well rounded, though because he's such a specialist in both ranged and close up combat he's also not very powerful. His sword attacks are fast and swift, though aren't as potent as his special moves, which take a bit longer to perform and are more complicated. Because of this some experienced players tend to attack first with the sword and then when the opponent is down move in with a special attack. Link's Hookshot is also one of the few grab moves that will latch onto a ledge, acting as a secondary recovery move."

    title: 'Samus Aran',
    description:
      "Samus Aran is one of the game's more complicated characters and is a challenge to master. She is usually forgotten amongst the mist of the easier to play as characters, though like most she can be a powerhouse in the hands of those who know how to use her. She has a great resistance to attacks and will commonly stay on the stage for quite some time. Oddly enough, despite her high defense, she is also one of the fastest characters in the game (only Captain Falcon is faster). Like some other characters, Samus Aran is fantastic in both close range and ranged attacks, and has some of the most devastating special moves, such as her charged shot which, unlike Donkey Kong's Giant Punch, can be used from far away."

    title: 'Yoshi',
    description:
      "Yoshi is another complicated character who is fantastic in the hands of those who know how to use him. One of his greatest strengths is the fact that he has the highest and farthest double jump in the game. Contradicting this, however, is Yoshi's unfortunate lack of a third jump. In lieu of a third jump, however, is Yoshi's interesting yet hard to master Egg Throw, which is hard to aim yet deadly. Yoshi is one of the only characters who can roll when in shield mode as well. His standard B move is a favorite among players. It causes the green dinosaur to shoot his tongue out at and enemy and engulf him as he did in previous video games, and then turn the character into an egg. Following this Yoshi can then beat up on the character until he pops out. One tactic used against new players is to stand at the edge of a stage and then gobble up an enemy and send him soaring down to his untimely death."

    title: 'Kirby',
    description:
      "Kirby is Hal's own character, so it comes to no surprise that he's also one of the most interesting. Right from the bat the most notable aspect of Kirby is his uncanny ability to suck in his opponents and copy their abilities, a move that he could perform in his own series of games. For example, if Kirby sucks in Mario and uses his copy move, he'll sport Mario's trademark red cap and will be able to shoot fireballs. If he does so to Samus Aran he'll wear her helmet and will be able to use Charge Shot. He also has an outstanding amount of jumps - a total of six plus a recovery move. Of course one of his major downfalls is his lack of fat, and thus he can be whacked around the stage pretty easily."

    title: 'Fox McCloud',
    description:
      "Fox McCloud is one of the faster characters in the game, though unlike Samus he's very weak. Nevertheless he's one of the game's better jugglers and can reflect. His blaster weapon won't send players flying, which has its pros and cons. He's relatively high on the user created tier list at number 4, though some tend to dislike his lack of real power. His recovery move, Fire Fox, is efficient yet some complain about how predictable the move is."

    description:
      'According to pro players, Pikachu is the best character in the game. He is currently ranked number one on the tier list for a variety of reasons, most notably his aerials, edgeguarding and recovery move. While light, it is hard to land an attack on the swift and small Pokémon. All of his special moves use electricity, and is down B move is sometimes infamous for how newcomers overuse it so often. His recovery move is considered by most to be the best in the game, and is fantastic at juggling characters.'

    description:
      "Luigi is an odd character since basically he is so similar to Mario, yet dramatically underpowered. On the tier list he is ranked 10 out of 12, and when it comes to comparisons Mario is almost better in every category with the exception of Luigi's up B move. He is an unlockable character who can be obtained by completing the break the target levels with all of the eight default characters, though as always the player will have to challenge him on Peach's Castle first before unlocking him."

    title: 'Captain Falcon',
    description:
      "Captain Falcon is the fastest character in Super Smash Bros., and is perhaps best known for his ability to perform a variety of combos. He's an unlockable character who can be unlocked by completing the single player mode in less than fifteen minutes. If the player successfully does so, then he or she will battle Captain Falcon on Planet Zebes. If they defeat him, he will be added to the character roster, if not, then the player will have to beat the single player mode in under 15 minutes again, and continue to do so until the character is defeated. It comes to no surprise that Captain Falcon is the fastest character in the game considering the fact that he originates from a game in which you race high speed futuristic vehicles."

    title: 'Ness',
    description:
      "Ness is an unlockable character with unarguably the most unique recovery in the game. He hails from the SNES cult classic EarthBound and his inclusion in the game may be traced to the fact that HAL helped create the Mother series. Ness' recovery, while unique and powerful, is hard to execute. Rather than just pressing B up and sending Ness soaring upwards, the player will have to maneuver an electric ball behind Ness and hit him, thus turning Ness into a human rocket. When this move is used against enemies it's very powerful yet dangerous to attempt as when you're controlling the ball Ness will remain motionless, setting him up for an attack. To unlock Ness the player must complete the single player mode on three lives without continuing. The player must then defeat Ness in the following match in Dream Land. If he fails to do so he will have to try again later."

    title: 'Jigglypuff',
    description:
      'Jigglypuff is a Pokémon character who was included because of its popularity in Japan. Initially Pit from Kid Icarus was going to take its place though due to the fact that not many people knew the character he was replaced with Jigglypuff. Jigglypuff was initially infamous because of the misconception that it was the weakest character in the game, though its true potential can be seen by its variety of special attacks. The character can be unlocked by completing single player mode with any number of stock remaining.'
